// A step of a Claude Code session, as the prototype shows it: the tool by its
// icon and its name, what it is at — a file, a command — and under it a look
// at what it did: the lines of the file it read, the diff of its edit, the
// command it ran with the end of what that printed.
//
// Everything here comes with the hooks. nook-hook forwards a few lines of a
// tool's result and no more; none of it is fetched, and none of it is kept
// once the session is gone.
