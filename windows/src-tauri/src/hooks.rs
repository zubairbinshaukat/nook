// Claude Code hook installation.
//
// The rule from CLAUDE.md is strict and is followed to the letter:
// read %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json, take a dated backup, merge without
// touching anybody else's hooks, show the diff, and write only after an explicit
// click. Uninstall removes Nook's entries and nothing else.
//
// Each hook is written in Claude Code's exec form — `command` is the relay's
// path and `args` holds the event name — so no shell is involved at all. The
// shell form it replaces ("\"C:/…/nook-hook.exe\" Stop") only worked in
// Git Bash: on a PC without Git Bash, Claude Code runs hooks in PowerShell,
// which reads a quoted path as a string and fails on the event name
// ("Unexpected token 'Stop'"). Exec form also makes spaces in the path a
// non-issue. A Claude Code too old to know `args` still runs the relay, which
// then reads the event name from the JSON on stdin.
